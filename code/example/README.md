### Example files


This directory contains files useful for running the example TWIS and E-TWIS analyses. It contains gene information in `cortex.PEC.prediction_gene_model_info.txt`, including gene ID, chromosome and position, the meta-analyzed results of low vs. high number of cigarettes per day `cpdL10H20_cortex.PEC.meta.txt` and those restricted to chromosome 21 for quicker loading `cpdL10H20_cortex.PEC.chr21.csv`, both useful for the E-TWIS analyses, as well as example gene sets. 


The example gene sets are of 20 genes each, drawn randomly from either the genes on chromosome 21 that were actually included in the example TWIS example, or alternatively, genes specifically expressed in certain cell types, found in the [Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/).
