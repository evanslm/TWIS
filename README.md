Code and scripts to run TWIS

https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.16.504187


### Organization

1. `code/` contains all the scripts to perform TWIS 
2. `figure_data/` contains all the data and scripts to recreate the data from the publication

The code here includes bash and R scripts used to perform a TWIS. It is organized by each step in the process, and it is not a unified single program. It is set up to perform an example analysis using publicly available 1000 Genomes data, and publicly released TWAS weights.
